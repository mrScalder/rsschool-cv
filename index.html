             <h2>Briefly About Myself</h2>
             <p>
                Have started my career as a manual tester in a small company with minimum skills, I became junior automatization tester. My keep interest about all IT and connected techlogies help me to solve new task in new systems and projects.
                I think what in past 5 years web frontend have a big step forward and set as one of most intrest think in IT and I didn't see no one project wich was not frontend connected and that`s why I think what the any IT engeneer must to know how frontend works.                
                I believe, that my ability to learn and to gain new skills will lead me through this path of becoming a proficient Frontend Developer.
